You are now required to build iOS apps using Xcode 15.4 or newer.\n- Changed AR Foundation dependency version from 6.0.1 to 6.0.2.\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Fixed issue [ARKB-58](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/arfoundation-application-crashes-when-arocclusionmanager-is-disabled-if-multithreaded-rendering-is-enabled-on-ios-devices-that-use-lidar) where iOS apps could intermittently crash when destroying the `AROcclusionManager` with multithreaded rendering enabled.\n- Fixed the native input provider so that it now explicitly sets **Device** mode as its only supported [Tracking Origin Mode](xref:Unity.XR.CoreUtils.XROrigin.TrackingOriginMode). The [XR Origin component](xref:xr-core-utils-xr-origin-reference) will always use **Device** mode as its Tracking Origin Mode. You should set the XR Origin component's **Camera Y Offset** value to `0` to avoid adding a height offset to your camera and trackables."

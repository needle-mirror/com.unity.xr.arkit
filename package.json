These classes were previously internal, and are now public.\n- Added C header file necessary to interpret native pointers: `Includes~/UnityXRNativePtrs.h`\n\n### Changed\n\n- Rebuilt static libraries with Xcode version 15.4 (15F31d).\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Fixed issue [ARKB-58](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/arfoundation-application-crashes-when-arocclusionmanager-is-disabled-if-multithreaded-rendering-is-enabled-on-ios-devices-that-use-lidar) where iOS apps could intermittently crash when destroying the `AROcclusionManager` with multithreaded rendering enabled.\n- Fixed the native input provider so that it now explicitly sets **Device** mode as its only supported [Tracking Origin Mode](xref:Unity.XR.CoreUtils.XROrigin.TrackingOriginMode). The [XR Origin component](xref:xr-core-utils-xr-origin-reference) will always use **Device** mode as its Tracking Origin Mode. You should set the XR Origin component's **Camera Y Offset** value to `0` to avoid adding a height offset to your camera and trackables."
